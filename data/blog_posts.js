        //         <p>When we look at Europa, we see a world covered in ice. But beneath that ice lies a liquid ocean that might harbor life. How do we study an ocean we can't see? We use math.</p>
        //         <p>Using the ROCKE-3D model developed at NASA GISS, we can simulate the ocean circulation driven by tidal heating. It's like forecasting the weather, but for an alien ocean where the 'sun' is the gravity of Jupiter pulling and squeezing the moon.</p>
        //         <h3>The Challenge of Data</h3>
        //         <p>We don't have many direct observations yet. Missions like Europa Clipper are going to change that, but for now, we rely on physics-based modeling to constrain what is possible.</p>

        //         <p>Moving from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to NASA GISS in New York was a big shift—not just geographically, but scientifically. I went from studying Earth's past climate to studying future destinations in the solar system.</p>
        //         <p>The core physics, however, remains the same. Fluid dynamics is universal. Whether it's the Atlantic Ocean in the Cretaceous or the subsurface ocean of Enceladus today, the same equations of motion apply.</p>

        //     content: `
        //         <p>Science should be reproducible. In the modern era, that means code. If I publish a paper about ocean currents, but keep the code that calculated those currents secret, I am only telling half the story.</p>
        //         <p>Open source tools like Python and libraries like xarray have revolutionized oceanography. By sharing our tools, we move the whole field forward faster.</p>
