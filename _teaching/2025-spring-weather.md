I supported a hands-on course taught by Prof. [John Marshall](https://oceans.mit.edu/JohnMarshall/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and Dr. [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} that integrates theory with rotating-tank experiments to study atmospheric and oceanic circulation. My role focused on working closely with students during lab sessions, assisting with experimental setup, instrumentation, and data analysis, and discussing how the laboratory results connect to concepts from geophysical fluid dynamics.

One student in the course, [Youran (Yoland) Gao](https://yolandgao.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, developed a particle-tracking tool to follow surface tracers in video recordings of the experiments for a final project. We continued this work after the course ended through regular brainstorming sessions, discussing design choices and analysis approaches. Yoland led the implementation, and I provided input on the overall structure and functionality. We plan to open-source the software after a few more iterations.

Over Summer to Fall 2025, I worked with John on updating the rotating-tank setup and improving the hardware. The updated system will be used in the next iteration of the course.
