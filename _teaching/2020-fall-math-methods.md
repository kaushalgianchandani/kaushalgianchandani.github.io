I served as the teaching assistant for a graduate-level course on mathematical methods used in scientific modeling, taught by [Prof. Nathan Paldor](https://en.earth.huji.ac.il/people/nathan-paldor){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I worked closely with students during problem-solving sessions, helping them navigate unfamiliar mathematical tools and address gaps in quantitative preparation.

In addition to instructional support, I developed and expanded the lecture notes by adding step-by-step derivations and intuitive explanations aimed at clarifying key methods and their practical use in modeling. These notes were designed to help students build confidence in applying mathematical techniques to physical systems and are available below.
