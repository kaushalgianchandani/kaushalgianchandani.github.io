I am a grad student in Oceanography with Prof [Hezi Gildor](http://hezigildor.es.huji.ac.il/) \(co-advisors: Prof [Yosef Ashkenazy](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~ashkena/), Ben-Gurion University and Prof [Eli Tziperman](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/), Harvard University\) at the [Institute of Earth Sciences](http://en.earth.huji.ac.il), [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://new.huji.ac.il/en), Israel.

My research focuses on better understanding the ocean's role in Earth's climate by employing state-of-the-art climate models. I analyze several terabytes amounts of complex data on climate variables (e.g, temperature, salinity, O<sub>2</sub>, and iron concentrations) generated from simulations. Subsequently, I develop theories based on geophysical fluid dynamics and climate dynamics to explain the different characteristics of the aforementioned variables.

During my doctoral studies, I investigated the physical and biogeochemical dynamics of the ocean during extreme icehouse and greenhouse paleoclimates --- the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth events (800 - 600 million year ago, Ma) and the Cretaceous period (145 - 65 Ma). Previously, I have carried out projects in statistical analysis of climate data and nonlinear dynamics.
