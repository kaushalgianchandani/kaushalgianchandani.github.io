        //     <p>My current research focuses on the fascinating oceanography of icy moons in our solar system, particularly Europa and Enceladus. Understanding the dynamics of these subsurface oceans is critical for assessing their habitability.</p>
            
        //     <h3>Ocean-Ice Interaction</h3>
        //     <p>I study the interactions between the liquid ocean and the overlying ice shell. Key questions include:</p>
        //     <ul>
        //         <li>How does tidal dissipation drive ocean circulation?</li>
        //         <li>What are the mechanisms of heat transport from the rocky core to the ice shell?</li>
        //         <li>Can we detect signatures of ocean circulation in the surface geology of the ice shell?</li>
        //     </ul>
            
        //     <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic text-center mt-4">Simulation of heat transport in subsurface oceans.</p>

        summary: "Investigating the controls on the westward intensification of wind-driven ocean circulation.",
        content: `... coming soon ... `
        //     <p>My research interest lies in understanding the fundamental drivers of large-scale ocean circulation. Specifically, I investigate the mechanisms behind westward intensification and how basin geometry influences boundary currents.</p>
            
        //     <h3>Key Questions</h3>
        //     <ul>
        //         <li>How does the aspect ratio of an ocean basin affect the strength of western boundary currents?</li>
        //         <li>What role does bottom topography play in steering these currents?</li>
        //     </ul>

        //     <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        //     <p>Western boundary currents like the Gulf Stream are crucial for transporting heat from the equator to the poles. Understanding their sensitivity to geometric and wind forcing helps us predict how they might shift in a changing climate.</p>

        //     <p>I use General Circulation Models (GCMs) to simulate Earth's climate during deep time. My focus is on two extreme periods: the hot greenhouse of the Cretaceous and the frozen "Snowball Earth" of the Neoproterozoic.</p>
        //     <p>By reconstructing these past climates, we can test the limits of our climate models and gain insights into the feedback loops that regulate Earth's temperature over millions of years.</p>
