I served as the teaching assistant for a graduate-level course on mathematical methods in scientific modeling, taught by Prof. Nathan Paldor{:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I worked with students during problem-solving sessions, helping them navigate unfamiliar mathematical tools and address gaps in quantitative preparation.

I also developed and expanded the lecture notes with step-by-step derivations and intuitive explanations to make key methods easier to follow and apply. The notes are available below.
