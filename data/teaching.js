//         My approach to teaching is grounded in the belief that physical intuition should precede mathematical formalism. 
//         In my courses, I strive to bridge the gap between abstract fluid dynamics concepts and observable oceanographic phenomena.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//         I believe in active learning strategies, encouraging students to engage with real-world data—such as reanalysis datasets or 
//         satellite observations—to build confidence in their scientific reasoning.
