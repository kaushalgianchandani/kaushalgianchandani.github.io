I am a postdoctoral assoicate with Prof [John Marshall](https://oceans.mit.edu/JohnMarshall/) in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS)](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://web.mit.edu/). Prior to beginning stint at MIT, I pursued a PhD in Oceanography with with Prof [Hezi Gildor](http://hezigildor.es.huji.ac.il/) \(co-advisors: Prof [Yosef Ashkenazy](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~ashkena/), Ben-Gurion University and Prof [Eli Tziperman](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/), Harvard University\) at the [Institute of Earth Sciences](http://en.earth.huji.ac.il), [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://new.huji.ac.il/en), Israel.

My research is centered around better understanding the ocean's role in Earth's climate system and applying this knowledge to celetestial bodies that may potentially have oceans. Currently, I am examining the circulation of the ocean under ice-covered moons in our solar system, e.g. Europa and Encealdus. During my doctoral studies, I investigated the physical and biogeochemical dynamics of the ocean during extreme icehouse and greenhouse paleoclimates --- the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth events (800 - 600 million year ago, Ma) and the Cretaceous period (145 - 65 Ma). I have also carried out projects in physical oceanography, statistical analysis of climate data and nonlinear dynamics.
