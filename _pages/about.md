I am a grad student in Oceanography with Prof [Hezi Gildor](http://hezigildor.es.huji.ac.il/) \(co-advisors: Prof [Yosef Ashkenazy](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~ashkena/), Ben-Gurion University and Prof [Eli Tziperman](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/), Harvard University\) at the [Institute of Earth Sciences](http://en.earth.huji.ac.il), [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://new.huji.ac.il/en), Israel.

The focus of my research thus far has been to better understand the role of the ocean (including the ocean biosphere) in the context of Earthâ€™s climate. Specifically, I employ state-of-the-art climate models to simulate climate conditions today and in the distant geological past, analyze the several terabytes of complex data on multiple climate variables (e.g., Temperature, Salinity, O<sub>2</sub> and Iron concentrations) generated by these simulations and develop theories based on geophysical fluid dynamics and climate dynamics to explain the different characteristics of the aforementioned variables.

During my doctoral studies, I investigated the physical and biogeochemical dynamics of the ocean during extreme icehouse and greenhouse paleoclimates --- the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth events and the Cretaceous period. Previously, I have carried out projects in statistical analysis of climate data and nonlinear dynamics.
